a) A workflow you’ve automated or improved 
<br/>Automation saves time structure sustains it<br/> 
At Bread Financial, I noticed that our reconciliation process for risk documentation was time consuming and error prone due to manual tracking. I created an automated Excel workbook with formula-driven flags that instantly highlighted inconsistencies, missing fields, and duplicate values. Using data validation rules, conditional formatting, and nested IF statements, I reduced manual checks by 40% and eliminated recurring input errors. I also added a dropdown-based status tracker, which made weekly updates more transparent for leadership and helped speed up compliance sign-offs.
Tool stack: Excel (formulas, data validation), Fiserv, ServiceNow

b) A social post (real or mock) “Professional tone meets brand purpose in every post<br/>
Here’s a mock LinkedIn post I would create for an internal analytics team celebrating a milestone:<br/>
🔍 Data That Drives Decisions<br/>
Big shoutout to our Commercial Ops and Data Engineering teams for successfully validating 1,000+ provider records across 3 integrated systems SAP, CAP, and UPS in record time!. Thanks to team collaboration, rule based logic, and streamlined Smartsheet dashboards, we resolved onboarding issues for multiple high-value accounts and improved data integrity across the board.
Tool stack: LinkedIn tone, branding strategy, light copywriting

c) A lightweight process or system you’ve built“Repeatable processes keep teams aligned—even when people change<br/>
At Moderna, I built a “Validation Tracker System” for Master Data escalations. Incoming provider records were often delayed due to issues like license mismatches or address format errors. I created an Excel-based process that included:
<br/>A multi-status dropdown (Pending, Blocked, Validated, Sent to SAP)
<br/>A timestamp log using formulas to track when each step was completed
<br/>Color-coded alerts for SLA breaches or missing license data
<br/>A companion Smartsheet summary view for leadership visibility
This lightweight system reduced ticket aging, improved team accountability, and gave execs a real-time view of where delays were happening.
Tool stack: Excel, Smartsheet, Teams, CAP, SAP
